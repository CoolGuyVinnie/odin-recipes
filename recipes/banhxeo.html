    <h1>Banh Xeo</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bánh xèo is a crispy, stuffed rice pancake popular in Vietnam. The name refers to the sound - the sizzle
        of a thin layer of rice batter when it's poured into a hot skillet. It is a savoury fried pancake made of
        rice flour, water, and turmeric powder.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <h4>Preperation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients except scallions in a large bowl for at least 3 hours,
                or overnight. Add scallions only right before making the crepes.
            </li>
            <li>Steam or soak mung beans in water until soft.</li>
            <li>Boil pork until cooked through and soft, then slice thinly.</li>
            <li>Remove shrimp heads and devein shrimp if desired.</li>
            <li>Wash bean sprouts and veggies.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Making Banh Xeo</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>On medium-high heat add 1-2 teaspoons of oil and some onions</li>
            <li>Immediately add a few pieces of pork and shrimp. Sauté, lightly
                 mixing until very lightly browned and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Pour in some batter and quickly tilt & rotate the pan so the batter 
                is evenly spread. Add more batter if it wasn't enough to cover the pan. 
                There should only be a thin layer of batter that almost flakes off at 
                the pan edges where it's thinner. If your batter doesn't do that and 
                is too thick, add a few tbsp water to the batter and mix to thin it out.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to medium. Add some mung beans, bean sprouts, and cover with 
                a lid for about 3 minutes, or until bean sprouts are slightly cooked. 
                The batter should also be slightly cooked and transparent around the edges. 
                This step cooks the top side of the ingredients and batter while it steams 
                since we won't be flipping the crepe.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid, lower heat to medium-low and wait for the crêpe to become 
                crisp. This takes about 5-7 minutes. This step lets the ingredients fully 
                cook through, including the batter. It also lets steam escape so the batter 
                can crisp up. Brush on a little oil around the edges if you're not seeing or 
                hearing enough batter to pan contact. Fold in half, transfer to a plate and 
                serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
